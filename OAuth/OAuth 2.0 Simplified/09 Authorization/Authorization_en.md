<h1 align="center">Authorization </h1>

The authorization interface is the screen users see when granting applications access to their account. The following sections cover how to build the authorization screen, what components to include in the interface, and how best to present the interface to end users.

When implementing an OAuth server, you are enabling a developer community to build applications that leverage your platform, allowing applications to access and potentially modify private user content, or act on behalf of users. Because of this, you need to ensure you are empowering your users with as much information as possible to protect their accounts and ensure they are informed as to what applications are doing with their accounts.
